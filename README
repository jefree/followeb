Followeb is a simple web application that allows you to follow 
a set of websites you want, storing a copy of these
every time that they are changed.

To help us, please create a virtual environment
with python-virtualenv and install the packages list
in requeriments.pip:

	virtualenv --no-site-packages followeb
	source followeb/bin/active
	pip install -r requeriments.pip

Followeb uses Django, so you should read the Django documentation 
to contribute to the project:
